TODO:
	We need to create a server that clients can connect to and play
	this will require an understanding of SOCKETS.

	We need to make clients, this should be dynamic, players could be 2 or 8
	it should work whatever the number

	the game should be running from the server, so upon starting the server
	the game will then be ready and players will begin playing.


ALSO, FOR FUN, WE WILL APPLY TDD (TEST YOUR FUNCTIONS, TRY TO BREAK THEM IF THEY BREAK, FIX THEM)
